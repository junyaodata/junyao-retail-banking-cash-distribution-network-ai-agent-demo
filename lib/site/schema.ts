 * The shape of `data/site.toml`, as TypeScript sees it.
 *
 * This file used to be `config/site.ts`: a TypeScript literal, which the
 * compiler checked for free. TOML gives that up on purpose, so that every
 * authored artifact of a dataset sits in one directory that can be swapped as
 * a unit, and so that the copy can carry real comments next to the sentence
 * they explain. What the compiler used to catch is now caught by `load.ts` at
 * startup: `REQUIRED_SITE_KEYS` for missing keys, `assertIconsExist` for icon
 * names. Both throw rather than render a blank.
 *
 * `icon` is still typed against the names `lib/icons.ts` exports, which is what
 * makes a component's use of an icon name safe. The value arriving from TOML is
 * what needs the runtime check.
