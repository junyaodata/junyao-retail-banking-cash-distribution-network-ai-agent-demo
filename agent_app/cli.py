"""
The application's command line: ``agent-app <command>``.

Installed as a console script by ``pyproject.toml``, so ``mise.toml`` names a
command rather than a file path. That indirection is the point: where a check
happens to live can change without every task, doc, and habit changing with it.

**Only application commands belong here.** Building and publishing the dataset
to PostgreSQL is a one-off setup step, not something this CLI runs.

Argument parsing only; the work lives in the module each command calls. The
parsing itself is ``fire``, which derives the interface from :class:`Cli` --
one public method is one subcommand, and its signature is that subcommand's
options. Adding a command is adding a method, with no parser wiring to keep in
step with it.

``fire`` accepts either spelling of a method name, so ``check-content`` and
``check_content`` both work; the hyphenated one is what the docs and tasks use.
