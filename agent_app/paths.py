"""
Every path this package needs, in one place.

Paths are facts about the source tree, not configuration: a swap rewrites the
*contents* of ``data/``, never the filenames.

Only paths that are facts about *this* source tree. Anything whose name belongs
to the dataset is discovered in ``dataset.py`` instead, so that swapping a
dataset never edits this package.

Do not add a path speculatively. An entry with no reader silently rots into a
pointer at a directory that no longer exists, which is what happened to every
entry this module has ever lost.
