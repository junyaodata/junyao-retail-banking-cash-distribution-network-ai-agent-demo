"""
Monthly LLM spend cap, backed by one DynamoDB row per (deployment, month).

**Off by default** (``Config.quota_enabled``): it needs a DynamoDB table that
does not exist until someone creates it, and it is meant for a public
deployment, where the person paying is not the person typing.

The entry points check that flag themselves and return early, so a caller never
has to guard the call. Same for infrastructure faults: **metering must never
deny service**, so a DynamoDB failure is logged and swallowed here rather than
in every caller. The one thing that does propagate is
:class:`QuotaExceededError`, which is the answer, not a fault.

Every function takes the ``dynamodb_client`` and the ``config`` explicitly rather
than reaching for the ``one`` singleton, which is what lets a test drive this
with a stub and no AWS. The client is built once in
:meth:`~agent_app.one.one_03_boto3.Boto3Mixin.dynamodb_client`, so this module
never sees a session and cannot reach any other service.
