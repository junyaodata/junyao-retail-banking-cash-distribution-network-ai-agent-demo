"""
Does the repo still agree with the content in ``data/``?

Every check here compares two things a dataset swap must keep in agreement, and
fails the build when they disagree. Hand-rewritten prose cannot be type-checked,
so the failures this catches are the silent kind: a prompt that queries a table
the previous dataset left behind, a kickstart button whose icon promises a chart
over a paragraph of prose. Nothing crashes. The app simply lies.

Two of the checks need the SQLite seed, which belongs to the teaching layer. They
degrade to SKIP rather than failing when that layer is gone, so this module stays
usable in a repo that has been stripped for delivery -- see :func:`seed_tables`.

Icon names and required ``site.toml`` keys are deliberately **not** checked here.
``lib/site/load.ts`` checks them against ``lib/icons.ts`` when Next.js reads the
TOML, which is a real check at build time rather than a second list to keep in
step. That is what ``mise run build-web`` is for.
