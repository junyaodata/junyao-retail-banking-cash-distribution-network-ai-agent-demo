"""
Translation layer between the Vercel AI SDK frontend and the Strands Agent.

The only place that knows both dialects: the frontend's typed message *parts*
going in, the AI SDK v5 Data Stream Protocol going out.

**Nothing here is provider-specific, and it must stay that way.** The message
shape the agent uses is the one AWS invented for Bedrock Converse, and Strands
kept it across every provider, so switching ``LLM_PROVIDER`` does not touch this
file. Provider-specific code belongs next to the model construction in
``one_04_agent.py``.

The request data model itself is vendored in ``vendor/vercel_ai_sdk.py``.
