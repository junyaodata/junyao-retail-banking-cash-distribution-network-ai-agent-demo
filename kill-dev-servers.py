"""
Kill this project's Next.js and FastAPI development servers -- and nothing else.

Usage:
    python kill-dev-servers.py [--dry-run] [--force]

The hard rule: a process is only killed if it can be proven to belong to THIS
checkout. Proof is one of

  1. it carries this checkout's dev marker in its environment -- see the
     `env` blocks on the dev tasks in mise.toml -- which children inherit for
     free, so the whole server tree is tagged by starting it;
  2. its working directory is the project root, or its command line contains
     the project root path (the fallback for a server started by hand); or
  3. it descends from a process that satisfied 1 or 2.

Anything else holding a dev port is reported and left alone, because the same
port number shows up in unrelated software all day long -- and the script exits
non-zero so `mise run dev`, which depends on it, stops rather than starting a
half-wired stack on top of a stranger's port.

Use --force to take those ports anyway: the dev tree holding them is uprooted
whole, wrappers included. A foreign process that is not in our way is never
touched either way. This app is meant to run one instance at a time.
