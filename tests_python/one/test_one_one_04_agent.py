"""
Test for the agent's read-only tools.

These call the tool methods directly, the same way the strands agent does at
runtime, but without building a model or an Agent -- so no API key, no network,
no tokens spent. The tools only touch the local SQLite database and the
filesystem, which is what makes that possible.

The write-operation tools are not covered here: they are commented out of the
agent's tool list and target tables that do not exist in this dataset.
