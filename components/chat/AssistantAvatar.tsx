 * The square that marks a bubble as the agent's.
 *
 * Three places show it: the banner above the conversation, every assistant
 * message, and the "thinking" placeholder. One component so they cannot drift
 * into three slightly different squares.
 *
 * The label is a fixed two letters rather than the agent's name from
 * `site.toml`: it has to fit a 32px box, and a dataset is free to name its
 * agent something long.
